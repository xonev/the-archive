A few weeks ago we - a small group at [Seeq](https://www.seeq.com/), my employer - [announced](https://geeq.seeq.com/2024/10/04/announcing-the-pr-reminders-open-source-project/) [the pr-reminders bot](https://github.com/seeq12/pr-reminders) open source project.

The pr-reminders bot is the bot that we have been using to send timely reminders to our teammates about pull requests awaiting review. We have found it to be helpful across multiple teams to keep the code flowing to production. And now you can set it up for your team. See [the announcement](https://geeq.seeq.com/2024/10/04/announcing-the-pr-reminders-open-source-project/) and/or [the repository](https://github.com/seeq12/pr-reminders) for more details - including how to deploy it yourself and how to contribute.

If deploying pr-reminders yourself seems too daunting or too much of a hassle, then don't worry! Nudgsicle - the easy-to-use reminder tool I'll be releasing soon - will use pr-reminders at its core but Nudgsicle will be much easier to use and configure for your repositories.

In future Nudgsicle newsletter updates, I'll be including an easy tutorial for setting up pr-reminders for your repositories. The newsletter will also be the first place to hear about Nudgsicle updates and early access. You can sign up for the Nudgsicle newsletter below:
